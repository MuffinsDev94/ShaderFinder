# ShaderFinder
A quick Unity editor plugin that can track down specific shaders inside of a loaded scene.

Drop this script into your project, when it compiles it will appear under the "Tools" tab.

Select "Find Materials Using Shader" and a new tab will appear.

You can adjust the tab window as needed.

Enjoy!!
